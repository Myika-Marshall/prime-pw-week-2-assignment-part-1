    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p> How come console.log is so sensitive? I found that most of my time was spent solving syntax errors...does that become less common as we grow?</p>
    <p> I am not sure if I did the multiple conditional correcty- but it showed up in my JS Log as it was supposed to- please advise</p>
